# HumanlikeAI
An AI companion designed for more humanlike interactions

Currently uses [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai) models. To use this project, you'll need a Mistral AI API key.

## Thought system

Before responding, the AI is prompted to generate a list of thoughts from its perspective. 

## Emotion system

The emotion system is based on the PAD (Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance) state model. Interactions will evoke emotions, which affect its mood. Its current emotions may affect its responses.

## Coming soon

I also plan to implement a long-term memory system to recall relevant memories from previous conversations. That way, it'll be a true companion that actually remembers you across sessions.
