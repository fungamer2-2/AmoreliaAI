Amorelia is a humanlike AI companion that doesn't just chat, but thinks, feels, and remembers. It is designed to truly form connections with users on a deeper level. üíñ

Currently uses [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai) models. To use this project, you'll need a Mistral AI API key, and store it under `MISTRAL_API_KEY` in a `.env` file.

## üí≠ Thought system

Amorelia doesn't just respond, it takes some time to think before responding. These thoughts are treated as the AI's "inner monologue." This helps make it a bit more realistic, and think as if it truly had its own personality.

Amorelia can also adaptively decide to think for longer before responding, especially if the query is complex or nuanced.

Periodically, Amorelia will reflect and gather insights to add to its memory, in order to gain a higher-level understanding of the user.

## üòä Emotion system

Amorelia has an emotion system, allowing it to feel. This system is based on the PAD (Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance) state model. When interacting with Amorelia, it will experience emotions, which influences its mood.

Amorelia's mood changes based on emotions experiences in the conversation. If no emotions have been experienced recently, its mood will gradually return to its baseline mood.

## üìù Memory system

Amorelia also has a long-term memory system to recall relevant memories and insights from previous conversations. It includes two types of memory: short-term and long-term.

- Short-term memory: Memories that Amorelia has either experienced recently or recalled recently. This is always available in-context, but has a limited capacity, and any memories that get flushed out of short-term memory are sent to long-term memory.
- Long term memory: Stores the memories and experiences to be retrieved whenever they become relevant. Recalled memories return to short-term memory.
