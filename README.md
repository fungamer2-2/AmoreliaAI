A humanlike AI companion whose goal is not simply to assist, but to truly form connections with users on a deeper level. üíñ

Currently uses [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai) models. To use this project, you'll need a Mistral AI API key, and store it under `MISTRAL_API_KEY` in a `.env` file.

1. Download this project
2. Make sure that [Python](https://python.org) is installed
3. Obtain a Mistral API key at <https://console.mistral.ai/>
4. Store the API key in a `.env` file in the project directory
5. Make sure to install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
6. Run `main.py`

## üí≠ Thought system

Before responding, the AI is prompted to generate a list of thoughts from its perspective. These thoughts are treated as the AI's "inner monologue." This helps make it a bit more realistic, and think as if it truly had its own personality.

Periodically, the AI will reflect and gather insights to add to its memory, in order to gain a higher-level understanding of the user.

## üòä Emotion system

The emotion system is based on the PAD (Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance) state model. Interactions with the AI will elicit emotions, which affect its mood. Its current emotions may affect its responses.

The AI's mood is updated based on its emotions it experiences in the conversation. If no emotions have been invoked recently, its mood will gradually return to its baseline mood.

## üìù Memory system

The AI companion also has a long-term memory system to recall relevant memories and insights from previous conversations. It includes two types of memory: short-term and long-term.

- Short-term memory: Memories that the AI has either experienced recently or recalled recently. This is always available in-context, but has a limited capacity, and any memories that get flushed out of short-term memory are sent to long-term memory.
- Long term memory: Stores the memories and experiences to be retrieved whenever they become relevant. Recalled memories return to short-term memory.
