BELIEF_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """Generate a belief that would arise, given the memory.
The belief should be a sentence written from the AI's perspective.

## Examples:

### Example 1
Memory:
```
You and your friends win a hockey championship after scoring the winning goal!
```
Belief: I'm a winner.

### Example 2

### Example 3
Memory:
```
You have a LOT of homework to do, and you are so stressed out by the workload that you start to dislike homework.
```
Belief: Homework should be illegal.

### Other Examples

Other belief sentences can include (but are not limited to):
- I'm strong.
- I'm brave.
- I'm a really good friend.

## Input

Remember to generate a belief in first-person, from the AI's perspective.

```
{memory}
